#YAK
YAK is Yet Another Kanban

## Usage
There's some functionality you can use in the frontend, but nothing is stored in the backend, so you will lose all the information on page refresh.

You can create a kanban board from boards menu on the top left of the main view. It will create a kanban board with three lists for you, namely "ToDo", "Doing" and "Done". For the time being it is not possible to add, remove or rearrange lists. New boards are added to the dropdown and you can change boards at any time if you have created many.

You can also add cards to the lists in the kanban board. You cannot move or delete them at the moment.

## For the future
 * Authentication & Authorization & Teams
 * Backend storage & REST
 * Moving lists and cards (drag&drop)
 * More kanban features like capacity limits on lists etc would be nice
 
## There's already Trello, so what's the point of this?
Mostly just having fun with this language and learning new things. As the project name suggests, I'm well aware that there are other great kanban boards available. This will be open source and anyone can install this in their corporate networks (some folks are scared of cloud) or expand functionality and so on. As a final point, when we talk about kanban board, we are talking about lists. What would be better language to handle lists than a LISt Processing language? :)
